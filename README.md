![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description 
The code provided in this repository builds a website that calls an API using serverside programming and TypeScript to properly indicate value types of objects recieved. A user will be able to input any major city in the U.S. and display a forecast for the next 5 calendar days that will include Temperature, Wind Speed, and Humidty. There is also a removeCity() method that allows the user to delete search history from the searchHistory.json file using the DELETE HTTPS request.
